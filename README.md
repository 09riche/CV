## Nick Richardson

I'm a zealous Full Stack Junior Developer, a recent graduate of the Makers Academy, looking for a role in which I can continue to extend and apply my coding and production skills, while learning more (ideally) about natural language processing, machine learning and the industrial internet of things. 

Before venturing into the world of tech I spent the best part of a decade working as a magazine editor, mostly at the London Review of Books, where I wrote, edited and commissioned articles, as well as managing the editorial team. I left the LRB to manage a start-up called Flier Group – a security consultancy specialising in drone-based technologies – through incubation. At FG I realised I didn't just want to be selling tech and writing about it – I wanted to be making it!
