## Nick Richardson

I'm a zealous **Full Stack Junior Developer**, a recent graduate of the Makers Academy, looking for a role in which I can continue to extend and apply my coding and production skills, while learning more (ideally) about natural language processing, machine learning and the industrial internet of things. 

Before venturing into the world of tech I spent the best part of a decade working as a magazine editor, mostly at the *London Review of Books*, where I wrote, edited and commissioned articles, as well as managing the editorial team. I left the *LRB* to manage a start-up called [Flier Group] (http://fliergroupsolutions.com/) – a security consultancy specialising in drone-based technologies – through incubation. At FG I realised I didn't just want to be selling tech and writing about it – I wanted to be making it. 

## Skills

#### Writing
I contributed many articles to the *LRB* on a wide range of subjects, including asteroids, tunnel boring, Schoenberg, the trial of Amanda Knox and Scythian art. I've also written in a freelance capacity for *Harper's*, *New York Magazine*, the *Guardian* and a number of music magazines, and contributed a chapter to a book about black metal (the Scandinavian music subgenre, not an actual metal). My writing experience hasn't been limited to journalistic work: at FG I composed an entire suite of marketing materials, including web copy, business plan and pitch deck. Writing professionally has prepared me well for writing clear, elegant code and given me a keen eye for bugs.
