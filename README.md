I'm an ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, recently graduated from Makers Academy, looking for a role in which I can extend and apply my coding and production skills while working with great people on a product I believe in and am excited by.

Before venturing into the world of tech I spent 8 years as a magazine editor, mostly at the [*London Review of Books*](http://www.lrb.co.uk/), where I wrote and edited articles and managed the editorial team. I left the *LRB* to manage a start-up called [Flier Group](http://fliergroupsolutions.com/), a security consultancy specialising in drone-based technologies. At FG I realised I didn't just want to be selling tech, I wanted to be making it.

## Makers Academy/Technical Skills
Makers Academy is a highly selective, 16-week intensive development bootcamp. The course emphasises clean code, XP values, object-oriented design, test-driven development and Agile working practices. Technologies I worked with on the course include Javascript (vanilla JS, Node, Express and React), Ruby, Rails, and a variety of testing frameworks including Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine and Cypress. I worked on several group projects while at Makers. The first was a rebuild of [AirBnB](https://github.com/n-ckr-ch-rds-n/stinkbugs-bnb), for which my team learned Node in a week. For the second my team rebuilt Facebook as [Acebook](https://github.com/simone-smith/acebook-off-the-rails), using Ruby on Rails.

## Additional Skills

#### Writing + Editing
I contributed many articles to the *LRB* on a wide range of subjects, including asteroids, tunnel boring, cat burglary, Schoenberg, the trial of Amanda Knox and Scythian art. I've also written in a freelance capacity for *Harper's*, *New York Magazine*, the *Guardian* and a number of music magazines, and contributed a chapter to a book about black metal (the Scandinavian music subgenre, not an actual metal). My writing experience hasn't been limited to journalistic work: at FG I composed an entire suite of marketing materials, including web copy, business plan and pitch deck. Writing professionally has prepared me well for writing clear, elegant code while editing the work of others has given me a keen eye for bugs. 

#### Management
At the *LRB* I managed the editorial team of ten, including editors, typesetters and fact-checkers. I drafted press schedules and liaised with outside writers and members of other departments to ensure the magazine was ready for publication before deadline, and I maintained the editorial department’s databases of writers and pieces awaiting publication. At FG I was responsible for seeing the company through incubation to launch – conducting market research, arranging and leading meetings with outside consultants, managing the initial marketing budget, assembling the marketing suite and seeking investment. My management experience has helped me take an overview of the software production process and to coordinate teamwork on larger-scale projects.
